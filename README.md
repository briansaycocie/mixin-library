# mixin-library
A collection of useful Sass mixins. This allows a direct drop-in to your existing Sass project. To include this in your project, download/clone into your stylesheet folder and include the `_mixins.scss` partial via @import:

```scss
@import "mixins";
```

## TODO
* Add more mixins.
* Organize file structure a bit more.
* Document :allthethings:.
